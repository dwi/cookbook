# Monetization

At least 10% of all revenue must be burned (SLP) or go into the community treasury (AXS).

### Basic monetization logic

* Player pays using SLP/AXS
* **At least** 10% has to be burned (SLP) or stored in the community treasury (AXS)
* The rest can be split between rewards to players for playing your game and to fund the development.

### How to burn or send to treasury

**SLP:** Burned by sending tokens to `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000` address. The [SLP contract ABI](../axie-developers-cookbook/run-a-ronin-node.md#contract-abi) also have function `burn()` that does the same thing.

**AXS:** Treasury address is `0xa99cacd1427f493a95b585a5c7989a08c86a616b`
